# ASCM
This codebase contains the implementation for the paper [An asset subset-constrained minimax optimization framework for online portfolio selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424011655?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=88cf8d5c8cb4aba5) (**ESWA**).

In this paper, we propose an asset subset-constrained minimax (ASCM) optimization framework, which generates optimal portfolios from diverse investment strategies represented as asset subsets.
